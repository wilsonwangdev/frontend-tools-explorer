import type { Tool } from '../types';

export const toolName: Tool = {
  icon: 'https://path-to-tool-icon.svg',  // URL to the tool's icon
  name: 'Tool Name',                      // Display name of the tool
  description: 'Brief description of the tool and its purpose',
  category: 'UI Library',                 // Must match one of the categories in types.ts
  docsLink: 'https://tool-docs-url.com',  // Link to official documentation
  githubLink: 'https://github.com/org/repo' // Link to GitHub repository
};
```

3. Import and add your tool to the array in `src/data/tools/index.ts`
4. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS:
  - v20 LTS (v20.0.0 or newer, default v20.19.3)
  - v22 LTS (v22.0.0 or newer, also supported v22.17.0)
- pnpm (v8.0.0 or newer)

> **Note:** This project requires pnpm as the package manager. We recommend using Corepack (built into Node.js) to manage pnpm:
> ```sh
> # Enable Corepack
> corepack enable
> 
> # Activate pnpm
> corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
> ```
>
> For more details on our package manager and Node.js requirements, see [PACKAGE-MANAGER.md](./PACKAGE-MANAGER.md) and [NODE-VERSION.md](./NODE-VERSION.md).

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/wilsonwangdev/frontend-tools-explorer.git
   cd frontend-tools-explorer
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   # Using Corepack (recommended)
   corepack enable
   corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
   pnpm install
   
   # Alternative: If you have network issues with Corepack
   npm install -g pnpm@8.15.4
   pnpm install
   
   # Note: Ensure you're using Node.js v22 LTS
   # Check your version with: node -v
   # If needed, install the LTS version from nodejs.org
   ```
   
   > If you encounter network issues with Corepack during git operations, see the [Troubleshooting section in PACKAGE-MANAGER.md](./PACKAGE-MANAGER.md#troubleshooting).

3. Start the development server
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:4321`

5. Test your changes locally before submitting a PR
   ```sh
   # Run linting checks
   pnpm lint
   
   # Test CI workflow locally
   ./scripts/test-ci.sh
   ```
   
   > For more details on testing CI locally, see [CI.md](./CI.md#testing-ci-locally).
